### What is this project about ?
* How Machine Learning can be used in Space?
* The challenges weather can pose on shuttle launches. 

### Space Centres collects data from a wide range of sources, including:
*	NOAA Weather
*	Satellite imagery
*	Remote sensors
*	Weather pattern experts

<br>

> #### Nasa has a documentation on  Weather Launch Commit Criteria which can be read [here](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/news/releases/2003/release-20030128.html)

<br>
### Some key factors that dataset takes into account regarding launches are:
* Surface electric field
* Temperature during Launch time
* Weather Conditions
* Cloud temperature
* Precipitation intensity
* Rocket velocity
